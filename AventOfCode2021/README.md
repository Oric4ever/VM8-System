Playing AOC 2021 on the VM8 system...

I'm currently enjoying programming AOC2021's puzzles on the VM8 system, 
it helps me verify the platform is perfectly suitable for such a task, even if more and more of these puzzles are designed
for 64-bit systems.

The standard integer type of the VM8 system is 16-bit only, whilst LONGINT is 32 bits. So sometimes a small multiprecision module is required.
Also many puzzles will require some thinking because of the limited memory (about 40 KB free when the system is loaded).
