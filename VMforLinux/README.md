VM implementation for Linux

This is a very ugly implementation due to the initial reverse-engineering required on Turbo Modula-2 in order to extract the specifications.
I will provide a cleaner implementation later...

This version has some modified or new opcodes that make it incompatible with the Modula-2 system (because work is focusing on the Oberon system now).

The preliminary work on profiling the VM aims to optimize the choice of opcodes...
